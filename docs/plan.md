# Development Plan for QuantaSerene

## Phase 1: Core Engine Development (In Progress)
- [x] **Task Prioritization Algorithm:** Design and implement a basic priority-based sorting for tasks. `(Done)`
- [x] **Conflict Detection Module:** Develop a module to detect basic dependency conflicts. `(Done)`
- [x] **Initial Scheduling Engine:** Build the first version of the scheduling engine that assigns tasks to available agents. `(Done)`
- [ ] **Agent Capability Matching:** Enhance the scheduler to match tasks with agents based on their capabilities.
- [ ] **Comprehensive Unit Tests:** Develop a suite of unit tests for the core engine components.

## Phase 2: Agent and Task Enhancements
- **Standardized API:** Define a clear and standardized API for agent and task management.
- **Advanced Conflict Resolution:**
    - Implement resolution strategies for time-based conflicts (overlapping tasks).
    - Handle resource contention among agents.
- **Task Dependencies:** Improve the dependency model to support complex workflows (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-one).

## Phase 3: Advanced Features and UI
- **Real-time Monitoring:**
    - Develop a dashboard for monitoring agent status and task allocation in real-time.
    - Implement logging for all scheduling events.
- **Alerting System:** Create a system to notify operators of critical events, such as scheduling conflicts or task failures.
- **Simulation Mode:**
    - Build a simulation environment to test different scheduling algorithms and scenarios.
    - Analyze the performance of the scheduler under various workloads.
- **Analytics and Reporting:**
    - Enhance the UI with advanced analytics and reporting features.
    - Generate reports on agent performance, task completion rates, and system efficiency.
